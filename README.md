# rustdesk_build_windows

Two powershell scripts to build your own rustdesk installer for windows.

The process is splitted in two: first installing the toolchain, second is cloning the rustdesk repo and checkout the current nightly. After that the installer is built. In the build.ps1 file you can set your server settings.
