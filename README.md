# rustdesk_build_windows

Two powershell scripts to build your own rustdesk installer for windows.

The process is splitted in two: first installing the toolchain (tools.ps1), second is building the official 1.2.6 version (build.ps1). ***_*Do not forget to closing and reopening the shell to also reload the created environment variables**_.** In the build.ps1 file you can set your server settings.

I've tested this on a Laptop with Win11 >Version 21H2.

On The First RUn you 'll get a Rustdesk Installer
On The Second RUN you 'll get a portable version
